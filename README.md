Team Kinetic is back and ready for action in Dr. Robotnik's crazy races. Featuring five playable characters, plus an extra follower as a bonus!

# The Story

After the events of their own (Haven't thought about one) adventure, Robuster, Team Kinetic's leader, received an invitation from Tails. Explaining how Dr. Eggman, who once wanted to conquer the world, has turned over a new leaf and is now helping out Tails with their new creation; The Ring Racer. And that him and Eggman wanted Robuster, and the rest of his team, to join in on the fun to race with others. While Robuster wasn't convinced that Eggman had changed his ways, he talked about it with his teammates. Dirk, being one of them, was very intrigued on how Tails and Eggman were working together on their project that involves using the power of ten-thousand rings into a singular vehicle. After a long discussion, Robuster accepts to take his friends to the Ring Racer Grand Prix, just so he can keep a short eye on Eggman to see if he really has changed. Plus, Dirk made a bet that he can beat him at something his really good at too.
